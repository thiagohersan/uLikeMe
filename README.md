# uLikeMe (on facebook)
An app for opening yourself up and allowing others to love you.

It consists of 3 separate pieces of code:
- uLikeMe-observer: the main web gui/user app for finding connections and people to gaze at. JavaScript: runs client-side pretty much anywhere.
- uLikeMe-client: application for the gazee. Python: runs locally on client's computer.
- uLikeMe-server: keeps track of active clients and observers, and makes connections between them. Node.js: runs in the cloud on a server.

# uLikeMe (on facebook)
An app for opening yourself up and allowing others to love you.

It consists of 3 separate pieces of code (for now):
- uLikeMe-observer: (**on gh-pages branch**) the main web gui/user app for finding connections and people to gaze at.
- uLikeMe-client: application for the gazee.
- uLikeMe-server: keeps track of active clients and observers, and makes connections between them.
